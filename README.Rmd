__fgeo.analyze__ provides functions to analyze [ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/) data.

## Installation

Install the latest stable version of **fgeo.analyze** from CRAN with:

```R
install.packages("fgeo.analyze", repos = these_repos)
```

Install the development version of **fgeo.analyze** with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo.analyze")
```

Or [install all **fgeo** packages in one step](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/index.html#installation).

## Example

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(fgeo.x)
library(fgeo.tool)
library(fgeo.analyze)
```

### Abundance

Your data may have multiple stems per treeid and even multiple measures per
stemid (if trees have buttresses).

```{r}
# Trees with buttresses may have multiple measurements of a single stem. 
# Main stems have highest `HOM`, then largest `DBH`.
vft <- tribble(
  ~CensusID, ~TreeID, ~StemID, ~DBH, ~HOM,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   88,  130,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   10,  160,  # Main stem
          1,     "2",   "2.1",   20,  130,
          1,     "2",   "2.2",   30,  130,  # Main stem
)
```

Fundamentally, `abundance()` counts rows. All of these results are the same:

```{r}
nrow(vft)
count(vft)
summarize(vft, n = n())
abundance(vft)
```

But that result is likely not what you expect. Instead, you likely expect this:

```{r}
summarize(vft, n = n_distinct(TreeID))
```

As shown above, you can get a correct result by combining `summarize()` and `n_distinct()` (from the __dplyr__ package). But `abundance()` includes some useful additional features (see `?abundance()`). This code conveys your intention more clearly, i.e. to calculate tree abundance by counting the number of main stems:

```{r}
(main_stems <- pick_main_stem(vft))
abundance(main_stems)
```

If you have data from multiple censuses, then you can compute by census (or any other group).

```{r}
vft2 <- tribble(
  ~CensusID, ~TreeID, ~StemID, ~DBH, ~HOM,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   10,  130,
          1,     "1",   "1.2",   20,  130,  # Main stem
          2,     "1",   "1.1",   12,  130,
          2,     "1",   "1.2",   22,  130   # Main stem
)
by_census <- group_by(vft2, CensusID)
(main_stems_by_census <- pick_main_stem(by_census))
abundance(main_stems_by_census)
```

Often you will need to first subset data (e.g. by `status` or `DBH`) and then count.

```{r}
over20 <- filter(main_stems_by_census, DBH > 20)
abundance(over20)
```

### Basal area

If trees have buttresses, then you may need to pick the main stemid of each stem so you do not count the same stem more than once.

```{r}
vft3 <- tribble(
  ~CensusID, ~TreeID, ~StemID, ~DBH, ~HOM,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   88,  130,
          1,     "1",   "1.1",   10,  160,  # Main stem
          1,     "2",   "2.1",   20,  130,
          1,     "2",   "2.2",   30,  130,  # Main stem
          2,     "1",   "1.1",   98,  130,
          2,     "1",   "1.1",   20,  160,  # Main stem
          2,     "2",   "2.1",   30,  130,
          2,     "2",   "2.2",   40,  130,  # Main stem
)
(main_stemids <- pick_main_stemid(vft3))
main_stemids
basal_area(main_stemids)
```

`basal_area()` also allows you to compute by groups.

```{r}
by_census <- group_by(main_stemids, CensusID)
basal_area(by_census)
```

But if you want to compute on a subset of data, then you need to pick the data first.

```{r}
ten_to_twenty <- filter(by_census, DBH >= 10, DBH <= 20)
basal_area(ten_to_twenty)
```

### Abundance and basal area aggregated by year

Example data.

```{r}
vft <- tibble(
  PlotName = c("luq", "luq", "luq", "luq", "luq", "luq", "luq", "luq"),
  CensusID = c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L),
  TreeID = c(1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L),
  StemID = c(1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2),
  Status = c("alive", "dead", "alive", "alive", "alive", "gone",
    "dead", "dead"),
  DBH = c(10L, NA, 20L, 30L, 20L, NA, NA, NA),
  Genus = c("Gn", "Gn", "Gn", "Gn", "Gn", "Gn", "Gn", "Gn"),
  SpeciesName = c("spp", "spp", "spp", "spp", "spp", "spp", "spp", "spp"),
  ExactDate = c("2001-01-01", "2001-01-01", "2001-01-01", "2001-01-01",
    "2002-01-01", "2002-01-01", "2002-01-01",
    "2002-01-01"),
  PlotCensusNumber = c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L),
  Family = c("f", "f", "f", "f", "f", "f", "f", "f"),
  Tag = c(1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L),
  HOM = c(130L, 130L, 130L, 130L, 130L, 130L, 130L, 130L)
)

vft
```

Abundance by year.

```{r}
abundance_byyr(vft, DBH >= 10, DBH < 20)
abundance_byyr(vft, DBH >= 10)
```

Basal area by year.

```{r}
basal_area_byyr(vft, DBH >= 10)
```

### Demography

```{r}
census1 <- fgeo.x::tree5
census2 <- fgeo.x::tree6
```

Demography functions output a list that you can convert to a more convenient dataframe with `as_tibble()`.

```{r}
recruitment_ctfs(census1, census2)

as_tibble(
  recruitment_ctfs(census1, census2, quiet = TRUE)
)
```

Except if you use `split2`: This argument creates a complex data structure that `as_tibble()` cannot handle.

```{r, error=TRUE}
# Errs
as_tibble(
  recruitment_ctfs(
    census1, census2, 
    split1 = census1$sp, 
    split2 = census1$quadrat,  # `as_tibble()` can't handle this
    quiet = TRUE
  )
)
```

Instead, pass the multiple grouping variables to `split` via `interaction()`. This approach allows you to use any number of grouping variables and the output always works with `as_tibble()`.

```{r}
# Recommended
by_sp_and_quadrat <- interaction(census1$sp, census1$quadrat)

as_tibble(
  recruitment_ctfs(
    census1, census2, 
    split1 = by_sp_and_quadrat, 
    quiet = TRUE
  )
)
```

The same applies for other demography functions.

```{r}
as_tibble(
  mortality_ctfs(
    census1, census2, 
    split1 = by_sp_and_quadrat, 
    quiet = TRUE
  )
)
```

A simple way to separate the grouping variables is with `tidyr::separate()`.


```{r}
growth <- growth_ctfs(
  census1, census2, 
  split1 = by_sp_and_quadrat, 
  quiet = TRUE
)
as_tibble(growth)

as_tibble(growth) %>% 
  tidyr::separate(groups, into = c("species", "quadrats"))
```

### Species-habitat associations

```{r}
# Pick alive trees, of 10 mm or more
tree <- download_data("luquillo_tree5_random")
census <- filter(tree, status == "A", dbh >= 10)
# Pick sufficiently abundant species
pick <- filter(add_count(census, sp), n > 50)

# Use your habitat data or create it from elevation data
elevation <- download_data("luquillo_elevation")
habitat <- fgeo_habitat(elevation, gridsize = 20, n = 4)

tt_test_result <- tt_test(pick, habitat)

# A list or matrices
tt_test_result

# A dataframe
as_tibble(tt_test_result)

# A simple summary to help you interpret the results
summary(tt_test_result)
```
